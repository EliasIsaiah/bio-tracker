Tackling the `Sustain` Challenge

### Objective
Using carnivorous Sundew plants and Sphagnum to improve air quality on the ISS and future Space exploration missions 

Sphagnum:

### What are, and why, sundews and Sphagnum?
Sundews are small, palm-size, carnivorous plants that trap and digest prey via mucilaginous glands that cover their leaf surfaces. Sphagnum is a type of moss, otherwise known as peat moss, that absorbs many times its weight in water and can develop anaerobic soil conditions. Both are crucial parts of wetland ecosystems, but may pose as an interesting tool in combating air quality issues when used together. Poor air quality is a threat to sustaining life on earth and expanding our existence off planet and has been shown to trigger asthma and diabetes. 

One aspect that decreases air quality is dust, which is largely composed of dead skin flakes.

Though most plants undergo photosynthesis and have a critical part in Earthâ€™s respiration cycle, carnivorous plants add a unique aspect to this equation due to their ability to extract nutrients from prey, such as insects. With external nutrient availability, they are more resistant to pests and able to grow in less nutrient dense environments. Carnivorous plants, such as sundews can also extract nutrients from flakes of skin, or dust particles.

### The Application

#### As an individual conducting Sundew and Sphagnum experiments, I want to be able to track the health of the specimens and the environmental conditions affecting it, and I want to store the data for use in statistical analyses.

Technologies:
* Database: Kintone

    Kintone databases can be quickly spun up with all of the different fields that are required for tracking the specimensâ€™ status.
    The database is accessed via Kintoneâ€™s convenient RESTful API.

* Back End: Python (Django)

    Python is more stable than the other likely alternative Node.js.
    Python is also popular in the scientific community, which is the likely demographic for the application.

* Front End: Vue.js

    Vue is chosen for its ease of use and rapid development cycle capabilities.
